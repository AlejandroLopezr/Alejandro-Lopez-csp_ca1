    <p><strong>El Salvador</strong>,(meaning "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">Saviour</a>"), officially the
         <strong>Republic of El Salvador</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a>:<em>República 
        de El Salvador</em>), is a country in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America">Central America</a>. It is bordered on the northeast by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras"> Honduras</a>, 
        on the northwest by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala"> Guatemala</a>,
         and on the south by the<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"> Pacific Ocean</a>. El Salvador's capital and largest city is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Salvador"> San Salvador</a>. The country's population in 2021

    <p>Among the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica"> Mesoamerican</a> nations that historically controlled the region are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenca">Lenca<sup>[12]</sup></a> (after 600 AD),<sup>[13]</sup> the

        <h2 id="2">Prehistoric</h2>
<p>Tomayate is a palaeontological site located on the banks of the river of the same name in the municipality of Apopa.
    The site has produced abundant Salvadoran megafauna fossils belonging to the Pleistocene. The palaeontological site
    was discovered accidentally in 2000, and in the following year, an excavation by the Museum of Natural History of El
    Salvador revealed several remnants of Cuvieronius and 18 other species of vertebrates including giant tortoises,
    Megatherium, Glyptodon, Toxodon, extinct horses, paleo-llamas. The site stands out from most Central American
    Pleistocene deposits, being more ancient and much richer, which provides valuable information of the Great American
    Interchange, in which the Central American isthmus land bridge was paramount. At the same time, it is considered the
    richest vertebrate site in Central America and one of the largest accumulations of proboscideans in the Americas.

<h2 id="3">European and African arrival (1522)
</h2>
<p >By 1521, the indigenous population of the Mesoamerican area had been drastically reduced by the smallpox epidemic
    that was spreading throughout the territory, although it had not yet reached pandemic levels in Cuzcatlán or the
    northern portion Managuara.[40][41][42] The first known visit by Spaniards to what is now Salvadoran territory was
    made by the admiral Andrés Niño, who led an expedition to Central America. He disembarked in the Gulf of Fonseca on
    31 May 1522, at Meanguera island, naming it Petronila,[43] and then traversed to Jiquilisco Bay on the mouth of
    Lempa River. The first indigenous people to have contact with the Spanish were the Lenca of eastern El Salvador.</p>

<h2 id="4">Independence (1821)</h2>
<p> In 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the Act of Independence of
    Central America, which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El
    Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of Chiapas) from Spanish rule and declared its
    independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala,</p>

<P>Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the Federal Republic of Central America.
In early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to
join the newly constituted First Mexican Empire under Agustín de Iturbide. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy
for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to San Salvador and suppressed dissent, but
with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the
provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces.
(Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.) When the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El
Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the Greater Republic of
Central America, which dissolved in 1898.</P>

<h2 id="5">Economy</h2>
<p >After the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo
    withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that coffee
    yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an oligarchy of
    just a few families.[49] Throughout the last half of the 19th century, a succession of presidents from the ranks of the
    Salvadoran oligarchy, nominally both conservative and liberal, generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the
    predominant cash crop, the development of infrastructure (railroads and port facilities) primarily in support of the
    coffee trade, the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production, the passage of
    anti-vagrancy laws to ensure that displaced campesinos and other rural residents provided sufficient labour for the
    coffee fincas (plantations), and the suppression of rural discontent. In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural
    police force.</p>

<h2 id="6">Geography</h2>
<p >El Salvador lies in the isthmus of Central America between latitudes 13° and 15°N, and longitudes 87° and 91°W. It
    stretches 270 km (168 mi) from west-northwest to east-southeast and 142 km (88 mi) north to south, with a total area
    of 21,041 km2 (8,124 sq mi). As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called
    Pulgarcito de America (the "Tom Thumb of the Americas"). El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the
    total national boundary length is 546 km (339 mi): 126 miles (203 km) with Guatemala and 343 km (213 mi) with
    Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is
    307 km (191 mi) long.</p>
